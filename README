### What Big Data means to me
To me, Big Data is any data that is a large amount due to there being multiple sources, the source being widely used, or the need to combine data into a larger dataset in order to better compare and analyze. It is data that needs work in order to be readable and usable but is useful for decision-making since it would be a large sample size and representative of the desired population. It can be dangerous since it is a lot of data and it is up to the data analysts, and data scientists to responsible collect, analyze, and utilize the data in order to benefit society.
